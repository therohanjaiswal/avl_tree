Program: To implement the AVL Tree
Note: makeFile "avl_tree" will work only on linux

Steps to run the program- 
    1. Open a terminal. 
    2. Compile the avl_tree.cpp file using gcc or mingw compiler. If you are using mingw compiler run "g++ avl_tree.cpp" 
    3. An a.exe executable file will be generated. 
    4. Run this a.exe file. A menu will be generated showing all the possible operations.
