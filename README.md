Program: To implement the AVL Tree
Note: makeFile "avl_tree" will work only on linux

Steps to run the program- <br/>
    1. Open a terminal. <br/>
    2. Compile the avl_tree.cpp file using gcc or mingw compiler. If you are using mingw compiler run "g++ avl_tree.cpp" <br/>
    3. An a.exe executable file will be generated. <br/>
    4. Run this a.exe file. A menu will be generated showing all the possible operations.<br/>
    ![menu](menu.PNG)<br/>
    5. Enter the number corresponding to the operations you want to perform.<br/>
    6. If you want to perform "Print tree" operation, the program will ask for a filename,<br/>
       then the image of the tree will be generated with the same filename.<br/>
